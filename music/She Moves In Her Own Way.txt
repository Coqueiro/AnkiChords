- (primeiro verso)
G                  Am                    C
So at my show on Monday I was hoping someday
                 Bm     D      G
You'd be on your way to better things
                    Am                         C
It's not about your make up or how you try to shape up
          Bm       D    G      C Am                 Bm D
To these tiresome paper dreams. Paper dreams honey.

- (pré-refrão)
G                    Am                         C
So now you pour your heart out telling me your far out
                    Bm   D             G
You're not about to lie down for your cause
              Am
But you don't pull my strings
          C           Bm           D      G
Cos I'm a better man moving on to better things.

- (refrão)
G   D           Am
Well, uh uh oh I love her because
   Bm        D       Em
She moves in her own way
    C             Am
Well, uh uh oh she came to my show
        Bm    D       G
Just to hear about my day.

- (segundo verso)
 G                  Am
 And at the show on Tuesday
               C
She was in her mindset
           Bm      D       G
Tempered furs and spangled boots
          Am
Looks are deceiving
         C
Make me believe it
          Bm       D     G       C
And these tiresome paper dreams
      Am                 Bm D
Paper dreams honey, yeah

- (pré-refrão)
G             Am
So won't you go far
                C
Tell me you're a keeper
              Bm  D            G
Not about to lie down for your cause
              Am
And you don't pull my strings because
            C
Cause I'm a better man
Bm           D      G
Moving on to better things

- (interlúdio)
Em    Bm            D         C
Yes I wish that we never made it
G               D
Through all the summers
Em          Bm   D          C
They're keeping us instead of kicking us
G                D
Back down through the suburbs
Em    Bm            D         C
