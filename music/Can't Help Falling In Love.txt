# Can't Help Falling In Love
# From Elvis Presley

C    G   Am        F    C    G7
Wise men say, only fools rush in 
 F   G7    Am       Dm       C    G7   C 
But  I  can't help falling in love with you 
 C     G  Am       F     C    G7 
Shall I  stay, would it be a sin 
 F    G7    C     Dm         C    G7   C 
If I  can't help falling in love with you 
 

 Em          Am     Em           Am
Like a river flows surely to the sea 
 Em          Am      A7         Dm     G7  
Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be 
 

 C    Em  Am            F    C    G7
Take my  hand, take my whole life too 
    F  G7    C      Dm         C    G7    C 
For I can't help  falling in love whith you
